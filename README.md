# Ft_containers
Project in C++. Recode vector's container, stack's container and map's container from the STL (Standard Template Library).

## Description
Implement the following containers: Vector, Stack and Map.
Each container must have the same parameters, the same member types and the same functions. They cannont be 20 times slower than the STL.

### What have I learned ?
>Use of "namespace"
>Use of iterators / reverse_iterators
>Use of STL
>Overload operator
>std::allocator
>Binary tree
>Red black tree


### What difficulties did I encounter?
This project was a bit long and a bit complicated to understand. 
At first, I started by implementing all the requested structures / functions such
as: std::pair /make pair, is_integral, reverse_iterator...
Then I coded the vector's container. It wasn't the hardest part as I mostly used pointers. Stack was built in continuity.
The main difficulty was for the Map container. I had connection problems between my binary tree and my iterators.
